great, the recipient is being recorded now, But i was wondering, i did an email send in the front end with a non-staff user with an actual email, and i am waiting for the email to be received, is it supposed to wait for a long time? have you tried the functionality of actually sending an email to the listed recipient/s ?

This is the data that ive actually sent an email to an actual gmail account:
    {
        "id": 12,
        "sender": "admin@gmail.com",
        "subject": "test?",
        "body": "gana?",
        "created_at": "2025-11-18T02:21:01.704860+08:00",
        "is_sent": false,
        "sent_at": null,
        "attachment": null,
        "recipients": [
            {
                "id": 14,
                "username": "holeeshet68",
                "email": "holeeshet68@gmail.com",
                "first_name": "dummy",
                "middle_name": null,
                "last_name": "account",
                "is_verified": false,
                "is_staff": false
            }
        ],
        "delivery_statuses": [],
        "total_recipients": 1,
        "sent_count": 0,
        "failed_count": 0,
        "success_rate": 0.0
    },
